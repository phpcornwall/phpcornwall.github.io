PHP Cornwall is a new user group, aimed at bringing together the extensive PHP community in Cornwall.

## The First meeting

PHP Cornwall is so new, there hasn't even been a meeting yet!

We'd like to talk to ***you***, the developers of Cornwall and find out exactly what you want from a user group.

For now, the easiest place to get hold of us is on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cornwallphp)
